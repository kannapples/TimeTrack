Next on the list:
1. 'Create Task' should then have a follow-up to select 'New Daily task' or 'New Weekly Goal'
1. projects - fix 'complete task' fx. incorporate creating a tracker from completing a task, including pre-populating fields.
2. tracker - Delete link changed to red X, also add icon for edit
- what happens when you delete a project that has a weekly task associated. Should there be a popup warning the user that the weekly task will be deleted too? Same with deleting weekly tasks. 
3. tracker - Add 'manage categories' settings option
4. 'Add to daily tasks' in create daily task popup doesn't work
5. default in today's date in 'add tracker' modal
6. hide 'completed' check box for 'add tracker' modal
- go through and delete all 'show' fucntionality, who needs it
4. CSS
5. Add a 'todo list' item for daily tasks. Can access and check off items on this list. Todo items would be transfers to next day's task if you complete the task today.

DAILY TASKS
2. AFter deleting, need to refresh the page - it gets stuck currently. same goes for completing a task.
3. go through and fix naming conventions
4. if user hasn't identifying tasks to do today yet, have popup when they first log in asking if they want to assign daily tasks. Maybe used stripped-down table for tasks with a big 'add' button. 
5. color-code project umbrellas
6. week view - block display where if there are 2 tasks under 1 project, and then 1 task under 1 project, they are all displayed in line with different colors bucketing them into projects. 

TRACKERS

11. make date a required parameter
13. Time on index page does not automatically update 
15. New trackers are ordered by date/ID not date/start-time

PROJECTS
- eventually, change edit to modal

TRACKER REPORTING
Day hours: how many hours total, show percentage of task. maybe horizontal stacked bar
Month breakdown - generate as part of progress email.

USER ACCOUNTS
1. add a bootstrap jumbotron for a welcome tutorial



DAILY TASK CRON
1. Completed tasks: (daily) mark inactive or delete the next day
2. Completed tasks: (weekly) Generate email with weekly/monthly progress. 
3. Monthly - popup with inactivated weekly goals. prompt to delete or re-activate.


PHONE FUNCTIONALITY
1. for time increments, have buttons for 0.5 / 1 / 2 / more. Allow additive choice, so for 1.5, you would choose 0.5 and 1.
2. This should be more heavily weighted on the time tracking and less on the daily tasks?
3. To do list (daily tasks) should be easily accesible here
