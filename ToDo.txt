Next on the list:
3. 'Today' FX: add a button that toggles view between week's tasks and todays tasks
2. fix 'complete task' fx. incorporate creating a tracker from completing a task, including pre-populating fields.

SCRUM
2. AFter deleting, need to refresh the page - it gets stuck currently.


TRACKERS
4.5 Delete link changed to red X
5. Change edit functionality: when you click on a field in the row, it takes you into edit mode
9. Add 'manage categories' settings option
10. when 'new tracker' is clicked, doesn't go to form page. triggers popup
11. make date a required parameter
13. Time on index page does not automatically update 
15. New trackers are ordered by date/ID not date/start-time

TRACKER REPORTING
Day hours: how many hours total, show percentage of task. maybe horizontal stacked bar
Month breakdown - generate as part of progress email.


SCRUM CRON
1. Completed tasks: (daily) mark inactive or delete the next day
2. Completed tasks: (weekly) Generate email with weekly/monthly progress. 
3. Monthly - popup with inactivated weekly goals. prompt to delete or re-activate.


PHONE FUNCTIONALITY
1. for time increments, have buttons for 0.5 / 1 / 2 / more. Allow additive choice, so for 1.5, you would choose 0.5 and 1.
2. This should be more heavily weighted on the time tracking and less on the scrum?
3. To do list (daily tasks) should be easily accesible here
