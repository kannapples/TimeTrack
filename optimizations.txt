1. assigning globals 'Project.all', 'ProjectModule.all', AND 'ScrumTask.all' for every update/new/edit action seems irrelevant
2. 


questions for presentation:
	1. my global accessing is probably sloppy?
	2. helper methods for scrum tasks in tracker controller... this is probably wrong... ?
	3. tracker model chaining... for storage, is it good practice to just store the scrum_task_id when thats all users input? I can get the rest of the info by chaining if i need to report on it.
