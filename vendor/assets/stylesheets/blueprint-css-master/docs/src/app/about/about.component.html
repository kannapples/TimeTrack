    Blueprint CSS works very well with component heavy applications such as Angular, Vue and React. Blueprint is built with Flexbox and CSS Grid.
  </p>

  <p>
    While we encourage use of CSS Grid and Flexbox in standalone CSS, Blueprint's goal is to make it easy to create common layout patterns with very
    little code. Small utility like classes scale very well on large teams of varying skill levels.
