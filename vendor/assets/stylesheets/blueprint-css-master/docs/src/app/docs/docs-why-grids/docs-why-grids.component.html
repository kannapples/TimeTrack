  I thought Flexbox and CSS Grid was to help get rid of CSS classes and keep our HTML semantic?

<p>
  This library has been designed for large scale websites and web applications where thousands of lines of HTML and CSS exist
  as well as many developers and teams contributing of varying skill levels. Grid classes and utility classes scale very
  well in these environments. This grid is to help layout only. HTML &amp; CSS should still be composed of well defined component
  styles. Please check out the following articles on this topic.

<blockquote>
  <p>For individuals weaned on an ideology where “semantic HTML” means using content-derived class names (and even then, only
    as a last resort), it usually requires you to work on a large application before you can become acutely aware of the
    impractical nature of that approach. You have to be prepared to discard old ideas, look at alternatives, and even revisit
    ways that you may have previously dismissed.</p>
